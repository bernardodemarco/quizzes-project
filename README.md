# Quizzes App

This is my first React.js project. It was the final test of [Pixel's](https://ejpixel.com.br/) web development course, which focused entirely on front-end development. As such, ***there is no*** user authentication, and quiz results are not persistent

Working on this project allowed me to put into practice all the theory that I learned during [Pixel's](https://ejpixel.com.br/) trainee program.

## About the project

This web application allows users to navigate through all of the existing quizzes. When a user clicks on a quiz, its description appears on the screen, and the user can answer its questions. After answering all of the questions, feedback is provided, including the total number of correct answers and a message. It is important to note that the results are not saved anywhere.

In addition to the quiz navigation, there is a search box for filtering quizzes and an option on the navigation bar called "HistÃ³rico" which allows users to view the quizzes they have already answered.

It is extremely important to mention that the data for this web application was fetched from an API developed by ***[Pixel](https://ejpixel.com.br/)*** solely for this test. Additionally, the images and design were also provided by ***[Pixel](https://ejpixel.com.br/)***.
